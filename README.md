## Architecture

### State Management — Riverpod

The app uses **Flutter Riverpod** (v2.6.1) with a layered provider structure:

| Provider                        | Type                  | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sqliteServiceProvider`         | Provider              | SQLite database singleton                                |
| `audioPlayerServiceProvider`    | Provider              | Platform channel bridge singleton                        |
| `bandCountProvider`             | StateProvider         | Currently selected FFT band count                        |
| `playerStateStreamProvider`     | StreamProvider        | Playback state from native (position, duration, playing) |
| `fftStreamProvider`             | StreamProvider        | Real-time FFT band data from native                      |
| `commandStreamProvider`         | StreamProvider        | Remote commands (lock screen, completion)                |
| `audioTrackNotifierProvider`    | StateNotifierProvider | Queue, current track, play/pause logic                   |
| `audioMetadataNotifierProvider` | StateNotifierProvider | Library list, file upload/delete                         |

### Data Flow

```
UI (Screens / Widgets)
        ↕  reads & watches providers
Riverpod Providers (State)
        ↕  calls methods / listens to streams
AudioPlayerService  (Dart)
        ↕  Flutter Platform Channels
iOS Native Layer (Swift)
  ├── AudioEnginePlayer   — AVAudioEngine + vDSP FFT
  ├── AudioSessionManager — AVAudioSession
  └── NowPlayingService   — MediaPlayer framework
```

## Native Modules (iOS)

The app does **not** use third-party audio packages. All audio processing is implemented in native Swift for full control over the FFT pipeline and audio engine.

### AudioEnginePlugin.swift

Registers and routes all Flutter platform channels:

| Channel                 | Type          | Direction        | Purpose                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `audio_player/control`  | MethodChannel | Flutter → Native | Playback commands & file operations |
| `audio_player/state`    | EventChannel  | Native → Flutter | Playback state updates              |
| `audio_player/fft`      | EventChannel  | Native → Flutter | Real-time FFT band data             |
| `audio_player/commands` | EventChannel  | Native → Flutter | Lock screen remote commands         |

**MethodChannel API (`audio_player/control`):**

```
play(filePath, title, artist)
pause()
resume()
stop()
seek(positionMs)
setBandCount(count)           // 16 | 32 | 64 | 128
getMetadata(filePath)         → {title, artist, durationMs}
copyToDocuments(filePath)     → persistentPath
listAudioFiles()              → [filePaths]
deleteFile(filePath)
```

### AudioEnginePlayer.swift

Core audio engine built on **AVAudioEngine** + **AVAudioPlayerNode**:

- Loads audio files via `AVAudioFile` with frame-accurate seeking
- Tracks position via a 100ms repeating timer
- Uses **load generation** to safely cancel in-flight completions when switching tracks

**FFT Pipeline:**

```
AVAudioEngine mixer tap (4096 PCM samples)
        ↓  Hann windowing
vDSP FFT (Accelerate framework, 4096-point)
        ↓  magnitude calculation
Logarithmic band grouping  (16–128 bands)
        ↓  dB normalization (60 dB dynamic range)
Power curve normalization  (visual exaggeration)
        ↓
EventChannel  →  PillarVisualizer in Flutter
```

FFT processing runs on a dedicated `DispatchQueue` with `.userInteractive` QoS to guarantee smooth real-time rendering without blocking the audio engine.

### AudioSessionManager.swift

Configures `AVAudioSession` for background audio playback and handles:

- **Interruptions** (phone calls, notifications) — auto-pause, conditionally auto-resume
- **Route changes** (headphone disconnect) — auto-pause

### NowPlayingService.swift

Integrates with the iOS **MediaPlayer** framework to:

- Display track title, artist, duration, and elapsed position on the lock screen and Control Center
- Register handlers for remote commands: play, pause, next, previous, seek

---

## Screens & Widgets

### Audio List Screen (`/`)

The library browser. Displays all imported tracks with title, artist, and duration. Supports:

- Swipe-to-delete with confirmation
- Tap to start playback
- FAB (+) to import audio files via the system file picker
- Mini player bar at the bottom when a track is playing

### Audio Player Screen (`/player`)

Full-screen player with:

- Track title & artist
- `PillarVisualizer` — large FFT visualizer, configurable band count
- Playback controls (previous / play-pause / next)
- Band count toggle cycling through 16 → 32 → 64 → 128 → 16

### PillarVisualizer

A `CustomPainter`-based widget that renders animated frequency pillars:

- Subscribes to the native `fft` event stream
- Smoothly interpolates (`lerp`) between current and target band values each frame
- Renders pillars with rounded tops and a hue gradient (cyan at low frequencies → pink at high)
- Wrapped in `RepaintBoundary` to isolate repaints

### MiniPlayerBar

80px compact player shown on the list screen while audio is playing. Includes a 16-band mini visualizer, track info, and play/pause + next controls. Tapping navigates to the full player screen.

## Data Persistence

| Storage                            | Usage                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SQLite** (`sqflite`)             | Track metadata (title, artist, file path, duration). `UNIQUE` constraint on `filePath` prevents duplicates. |
| **App Documents** (`audio_files/`) | Imported audio files copied into the app's sandboxed Documents directory via iOS `FileManager`.             |

When the app starts, `AudioMetadataNotifier` scans the Documents directory and reconciles the disk state with the database — removing stale entries and importing any untracked files.
